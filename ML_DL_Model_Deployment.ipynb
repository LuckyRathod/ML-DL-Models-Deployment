    "1. Do the Model Training and save Model with any of the following extensions (.pkl , .sav ,.pb ,.h5 ,.pt ,.pth , .tfjs)\n",
    "2. Host the Models in Server Side using Frameworks like Flask,Django,FastAPI and expose it as API\n",
    "3. This API Endpoint can be consumed by any Front End Application (Mobile App,Desktop App,Web App)\n",
