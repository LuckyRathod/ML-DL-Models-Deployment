   Whenever you create New Instance - Generate new key pair -- Download Key Pair (PEM File)
4. Download Putty -- It helps you to connect to Ubuntu Server
   Putty contains PuttyGen -- It Helps you to create Private Key from PEM File 
   This Private key helps you to Interact with AWS EC2 Instance
5. WinSCP - Helps you to deploy your code in EC2 Intance
   HostName -- Go to your Instance -- Connect -- SSH Client -- Public DNS
   Username -- ubuntu
   Password -- Advanced -- SSH -- Authentication -- Private Key (Choose File which was created by PuttyGen)
   
   Upload your Project
